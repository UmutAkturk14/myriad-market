## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** MM | Myriad Market leverages the power of Rails for its backend, providing a robust and flexible foundation for building complex web applications.

- **Authentication & Authorization:** The application employs the `Devise` gem to manage user authentication and utilizes `Pundit` for fine-grained authorization control.

- **Testing:** We prioritize code quality with extensive testing using tools like `RSpec`, `Factory Bot`, and `Shoulda Matchers`.

- **Database:** PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable relational database, stores and manages the application's data efficiently.
